1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and decision-making. AI systems can analyze data, detect patterns, and adapt to new situations with minimal human intervention.

AI combines techniques from computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and engineering to build intelligent systems. Today, AI is applied in various fields such as healthcare, education, finance, robotics, transportation, gaming, and customer support.

2. Key Goals of AI

To create systems that think like humans
(e.g., reasoning, decision-making)

To create systems that act like humans
(e.g., robotics, human-like behaviour)

To build systems that think rationally
(logical problem solving)

To build systems that act rationally
(intelligent agents making optimal decisions)

3. Characteristics of an Intelligent System

Learning – ability to improve from past experience

Reasoning – drawing logical conclusions

Problem-solving – selecting the best solution

Perception – understanding the environment (vision, sound, sensors)

Language understanding – ability to interpret human language

Autonomy – working with minimum human support

4. Types of Artificial Intelligence
A. Based on Capability

Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Performs one specific task

Examples: Siri, Google Assistant, recommendation systems

General AI (Strong AI)

Human-level intelligence

Can perform any intellectual task

Still theoretical; not yet developed fully

Super AI

More intelligent than humans

Can make decisions better than humans

Only a future concept

B. Based on Functionality

Reactive Machines

No memory, act only based on present input

Example: IBM Deep Blue chess computer

Limited Memory AI

Can store past data temporarily

Used in self-driving cars

Theory of Mind AI

Can understand emotions, beliefs

Still under research

Self-Aware AI

Has its own consciousness

Only theoretical

5. Major Areas of AI
1. Machine Learning (ML)

ML enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming.
Types:

Supervised learning

Unsupervised learning

Reinforcement learning

2. Deep Learning

Advanced ML using neural networks with multiple layers.
Used in image recognition, speech recognition, etc.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Enables machines to understand human language.
Examples: ChatGPT, translation, chatbots.

4. Computer Vision

Allows machines to interpret and understand visual information.
Examples: Face detection, object recognition.

5. Robotics

AI used to control robots for automation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc.

6. Expert Systems

Software mimicking human experts in decision-making.
Examples: medical diagnosis systems.
